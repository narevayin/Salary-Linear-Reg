The Employees.csv file records data about the employees of a company. The dataset is from 
Business Analytics for Managers by Wolfgang Jank. In this problem, the managers are 
concerned with the issue of equal pay in the company. If we compare male and female 
employees with the same level of experience, are they paid the same on average?
1. Split the data into training and test sets and perform Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Estimate a linear regression
3. Model Evaluation
1. EDA: check the dependency between salary and gender, salary and experience, salary and 
experience by gender
2. you may need to do some data preparation
3. linear regression of salary by female + experience; also log transformation of salary may 
improve the results
4. visualize the regression
5. evaluate the models by rmse or/and r2 metrics
